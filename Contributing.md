# 🤝 Contributing to Requiem Nexus

Welcome to Requiem Nexus.

This is not just a codebase—it is a **teaching system**, an **architectural reference**, and a **philosophical stance**.

By contributing, you agree to uphold the **Antigravity Philosophy**.

## 🪐 The Antigravity Pledge

All contributions must:

- Reduce cognitive load
- Increase clarity
- Preserve traceability

If your change makes the system harder to reason about, it will be rejected—even if it “works”.

---

## 🧠 Contribution Principles

1. **Explicit over clever**  
   Readability always wins.

2. **Understanding over speed**  
   Shipping fast is meaningless if the system becomes opaque.

3. **Traceability is mandatory**  
   Every change must be traceable from UI → logic → data.

4. **Teach through code**  
   Assume the next reader is learning.
