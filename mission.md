# 🩸 Project: Requiem Nexus

## 🌌 The Mission

To build the definitive, high-performance digital ecosystem for **Vampire: The Requiem (Chronicles of Darkness)**.

**Requiem Nexus** is designed to eliminate the friction of character management, allowing Storytellers and players to focus on the _Danse Macabre_ rather than the math. By leveraging the reactive power of C# and the Antigravity philosophy, we aim to provide a "Beyond"-style experience that is as fast as a digital app but as deep as a leather-bound sourcebook.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Philosophy

- **Engine:** .NET 10 with a "Zero-JS" Reactive Framework (Antigravity/Blazor).
- **Infrastructure:** Windows-optimized deployment with robust PowerShell-driven automation.
- **Data Integrity:** PostgreSQL for relational Kindred data; JSONB for dynamic Merits/Conditions.
- **UI/UX:** "Modern Gothic" aesthetic—Crimson on Charcoal, prioritizing speed, accessibility, and immersion.

## 🎯 Key Objectives

### 1. The Living Sheet

Create a character sheet that isn't just a digital form, but a reactive rules engine.

- **Auto-Calculations:** Instant updates for Health, Willpower, Defense, and Speed.
- **The Dot System:** A tactile, interactive interface for Attributes, Skills, and Disciplines.
- **State Management:** Real-time synchronization between the Player and the Storyteller.

### 2. The XP Ledger

An immutable, transparent system for tracking Kindred growth.

- **Audit Logs:** Every point spent is recorded and reversible by the Storyteller.
- **Validation:** Prevent illegal stat combinations based on the Chronicles of Darkness ruleset.

### 3. The Dice Nexus

A native, high-performance dice engine built into the UI.

- **Rule Support:** Full support for 10-again, 9-again, 8-again, and rote actions.
- **Contextual Rolling:** Click an Attribute + Skill directly on the sheet to initiate a roll.

## ⚖️ Legal & Ethical Guardrails

- **Fan Content Policy:** Requiem Nexus is a fan project. It will not include verbatim proprietary text from Onyx Path or Paradox Interactive.
- **The "Empty Shell" Model:** The platform provides the _structure_; users provide the _content_ (descriptions, lore, homebrew).

- [ ] Initialize C# Backend and Database Schema.
- [ ] Implement the Core Attribute and Skill Grid.
